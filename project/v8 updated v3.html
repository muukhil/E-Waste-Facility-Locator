        <h1>Welcome to Our E-Waste Awareness Page</h1>
        <p>In today's digital age, electronic devices have become an essential part of our lives. However, their rapid advancement has given rise to a pressing concern - electronic waste, or E-Waste. This page is dedicated to highlighting the importance of collecting and responsibly managing E-Waste for the well-being of our environment and ourselves.</p>

        <h3>Environmental Impact</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Electronic devices contain hazardous materials such as lead, mercury, and cadmium, which can harm the environment when improperly disposed of.</li>
            <li>Recycling E-Waste reduces the need for mining and manufacturing of new raw materials, conserving natural resources and energy.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Human Health</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Improper disposal of E-Waste can expose communities to toxic substances, leading to health problems like respiratory issues and cancer.</li>
            <li>Collecting E-Waste responsibly safeguards the health and well-being of both humans and ecosystems.</li>
        </ul>

        </div>
        <h3>Resource Recovery</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>E-Waste often contains valuable materials like gold, silver, and rare metals that can be extracted through recycling.</li>
            <li>Proper collection and recycling contribute to a circular economy by recovering these valuable resources.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>How is E-Waste Collected?</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Local Collection Centers:</strong> Many communities have designated collection points where residents can drop off their old electronics. These centers often partner with recycling facilities or manufacturers to ensure proper disposal.</li>
            <li><strong>E-Waste Recycling Events:</strong> Organizations, municipalities, or schools may organize periodic E-Waste recycling events, making it convenient for people to dispose of their electronics safely.</li>
            <li><strong>Retailer Take-Back Programs:</strong> Some electronics retailers offer take-back programs, allowing customers to return old devices for proper disposal when purchasing new ones.</li>
            <li><strong>Mail-in Programs:</strong> Several companies offer mail-in programs, where you can ship your old electronics for recycling, often free of charge.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Tips for Responsible E-Waste Collection:</h2>
